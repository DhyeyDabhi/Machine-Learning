# Machine-Learning
The Repo Would contain all the basic algorithms of Machine Learning, which would contain the main logic code behind the ML algo, as well as an example of the respective algorithm,
using the python libraries.

Current Algos:-
1.) Linear Regression
2.) Logistic Regression
3.) K-Means Algorithm
4.) Shallow Neural Network
